He's the founder and CEO of his multi-media company, [[12 At Midnight, LLC]].

He started his YouTube channel by uploading Minecraft videos in mid-2015, which mostly about redstone contraptions, but has shifted content several times, ranging from vlogs, SFM animations, to producing and writing music full-time as early as in 2017. He debuted with the self-produced debut album ''[[Horizon]]''.
==YouTube career==
===2012-2014: Beginnings===
As he started YouTube, he slowly resides from programming and takes on new ventures, such as producing music and making videos later on. He has made videos with his dad's phone that has a touchscreen and despite the limited functions such as going through menus to add music, add clips, etc. and he also fiddles around with previous video editors, AVS Video Editor, and VideoPad Video Editor as free alternatives as he can't get Sony Vegas at the time, however, he didn't have a YouTube channel because he's too young to own one.

In 2012, he was binge-watching Minecraft Redstone related content, specifically ACtennisAC, he had a fascination with the Rube Goldberg machine, involving around marbles, and things that involve around machinery.

In mid-2013, before he took on video editing on Sony Vegas, he used VSDC Free Video Editor. His strong desire for editing videos is by watching several videos from SMG4. He began his YouTube channel back in 2013 called [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX66tenVOtPMCqFyy8_N5Tw C-Gear]. He lost the login info to the account and made a new one on November 29, 2014, at 8:11PM called ''50ShadesOfKoopa''. The origin of the name ''50ShadesOfKoopa'' was at the end of an SMG4 video, pretty unsure why he chose the name in the first place.

In late-2014, he learned to properly how to use Sony Vegas for the first time.
===2015-2016: Minecraft series, and ''YouTube Story''===
He has gained a huge interest in Minecraft, channels such as SSundee, Crainer, SethBling, Mumbo Jumbo, FVDisco, and ACtennisAC was his initial inspiration for making Minecraft videos. Specifically, Minecraft videos that mostly involves around mods and Redstone. The first Minecraft video was titled "Minecraft 2GB RAM Test", the video consists of him inside a cave exploding blocks of TNT as his frame rate drops significantly. The video went 300+ views in a few weeks. He has uploaded several Minecraft-related videos but has never gained so many views ever since. His channel was renamed from ''DarkShadesofKoopa'' to ''FreakingFoxyFTW''[[File:Kokoro2016.jpg|alt=|240x240px|Picture taken in May 2016.|thumb]]
His first Minecraft video was deleted by accident, it was re-uploaded on July 9, 2020<ref>[https://youtu.be/uurZOTujq-4 Minecraft 2GB RAM Test (Reupload)] - retrieved July 29, 2020.</ref>. On April 21, 2016 - he founded ''Sandbox Networks, LLC'' as a multi-channel network for Minecraft creators but it was scrapped. It was never established further of his Minecraft videos. A month later, he uploaded the first Minecraft Survival series, and a follow-up episode on June 10, he uploaded his last Minecraft video on June 28, 2016<ref>His last Minecraft video: [https://youtu.be/xVX-NCGYbaU ''Minecraft 1.10 Survival: MOBS ARE THE WORST!'']</ref>.

From early to mid-2016, he has uploaded several redstone-related Minecraft videos. He also stated that he was inspired by several MLG edits and channels like Pyrocynical, NFKRZ, and Materialisimo got him motivated to make more videos with more editing effort and slowly stepped away from making Minecraft videos and more on heavily edited videos. He merged into from personal to a brand account and renamed his channel name to ''FreakingFoxy // Minecraft & Gaming.'' He would upload milestone videos and home to a now-defunct series [[YouTube Story|''YouTube Story'']] and ''[[List of Discontinued projects|A KIND MESSAGE]]'' which both spans 2 episodes.

Under the heavy influence in the CS:GO community in late-2016, he watched several edits which got him to learn After Effects and Premiere Pro as to expand and experience new workflows, he still uses Premiere Pro today.

===2017-2019: ''Retarted Comments,'' beginning developments of ''FNAF: The Last Hope,'' and unexpected growth===
At the beginning of 2017, he uploaded vaporwave-related videos, watered-down FNAF Edits and learned to use Source Filmmaker, and uploaded his first SFM animation on April 16, 2017, <ref>SFM Animation: [https://youtu.be/_CeBJeoMZv8 SFM FNAF CYKA BLYAT TEST 60FPS]</ref>, which contains samples from a former CS:GO YouTuber TheRussianTV. However, he has incorporated SFM animations in some videos.

A month later on May 6th, he uploaded various ''SFM Speedart'' videos and has uploaded 8 total so far.

In April 2017, he transitioned between editing workstation from Sony Vegas Pro 11 to Adobe products such as Premiere Pro and After Effects to expand on complicated learning curves.

[[File:Kokoro2019.jpg|thumb|241x241px|Kokoro in 2019]]
In June 2017, he renamed his channel once again to ''skeptical'' and ''Skeptically'', as he got the name from a channel called Sethical, and used the word "Skeptical" rhymes with it.

He renamed his channel again to ''Kozoro Husky'' before joining the furry fandom, the name ''Kozoro'' was a name from an artist in Ninety9Lives. Knowing he would get in legal trouble for using the ''Kozoro'' name for some reason. He changed his channel name to ''Kokoro Husky'' for the final time.
