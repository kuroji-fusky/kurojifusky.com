It also features its own soundtrack. 

Background

Production starts at October 2017, after watching iDubbbz's Content Cop - Jake Paul, he got inspired on the structure, the setup and the overall atmosphere of the episode.

It was originally called "Five Nights at Freddy's: The Last Tape" but it was changed mainly because the issues with SEO.

Progress started to slow down in the rest of 2018 as it started to lost motivation.

It was primarily going to be a 5-episode series with complete storyline but due to technical difficulties and other issues, it will be an hour long documentary. The entire project size has expanded more than half a terabyte consisting of 4K footage and third party files which makes managing the project more difficult in post-production.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the project went open again and get a lot more progress ever since.
Teasers
Lost Videocassette

The first teaser uploaded was on January 31, 2019. It appears it was from a VHS tape from was owned by Videocassette Preservation Company, Inc., and it was recorded in February 19, 1997. The video opens a wanderer going to a forest, presumably at noon, during the duration of the tape, sounds start to distort and various clips start to play. The clip ends with the wanderer saying "We made it!", without giving any context, as it is most likely the VHS itself was severely damaged and wasn't taken cake properly.

At the end of the video, the first episode was supposed to premiere on May 1st, 2020, but never come to fruition due to COVID-19 and project management constraints.
