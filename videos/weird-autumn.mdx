Weird Autumn + Good Days is a music video self-produced and directed by Kokoro Husky, with the aid of his father. It was released on October 1, 2018, and was re-uploaded three days later due to quality issues. The song features a cover song "Weird Autumn" from a game Night in the Woods, originally composed by indie-game developer Alec Holowka.

It also features an instrumental version of the song Good Days from his debut album Nostalgia Vibes: Reincarnation, which is a sample from "Stickerbrush Symphony" from a game Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest, originally composed by David Wise. Accompanied by footage of him during his young days, usually around 2008 to 2011.

Within 6 months of the video's release, it was claimed by Screenwave Media, in which the cover song was performed by CG5.

In June 7, 2020, it was automatically claimed again, but through Kokoro Husky's distributor, ONErpm, from a song - Good Days, which was released and to possibly gain half of the revenue.
Background

The video is filmed in Burnham Park, it was filmed on Friday, September 7, 2018, from 7 to 11 AM, using his dad's phone, which is a Samsung Galaxy A5, and a GoPro HERO to shoot a car timelapse scene. It was planned back in August as it contains early footage from "800 subscribers lol" which appears that a camera was slowly panning behind him while a list of subscribers we're shown - it was cut short as he looks behind, and the suspense music ends.

There we're photos taken in July 2019 at SM City Baguio, as Greggory Lee, as evident with his black leather jacket with different poses. The black leather jacket itself costed him almost $100 or PHP 5,000.

A remastered of the music video was planned in mid-2019, but was cancelled due project constraints such as school projects in 2019, and recently to the COVID-19 pandemic.
