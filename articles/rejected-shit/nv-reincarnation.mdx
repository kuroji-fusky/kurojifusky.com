Background

Following the release of his music video Weird Autumn, released on October 1, 2018. He produced 'inspiration' as a follow-up.

An unreleased EP on April 2019, called YEAR 2045 which contained tracks "Stargazing, Pt. II"[note 1], "lonely and isolated"[note 2], and "dawn", and it was merged from the nostalgia vibes album instead.

In early 2020, "Nostalgia Vibes" and "NEW DECADE" are separate albums and will be combined as a Nostalgia Vibes album series it was going to be split up into separate EPs, "Unmasked, Identify", "NEW DECADE" ,and "Canis Majoris" respectively to convey a story, but it was going to be merged once again on a supposedly repackaged album "Nostalgia Vibes: Reincarnation".
Music and lyrics

The album is mixed with downtempo, alternate rap, and dreamy sounds.

"interlude: Solitude", according to his SoundCloud description of this track, "After reading the comic 'Art & Biro' by pandapaco. I thought I'd attempt to compose an orchestral piece in order to convey true emotions that are radiating from this comic".

The closing track "Миглоко", is a lo-fi ambient track. The track name translates to "Migloco" or pronounced as "Migloko", which referrers and dedicates of a name of a friend of his on Discord, to which he is "anxious" to talk to since they've been friends for a few months, and "translated" it into music form, marking it as a final track in the album.
